# Bank_V1
This version of a simple bank allows the user (the teller) to create accounts, deposit/withdraw from those accounts, view/edit them, and print out all accounts. This version of it uses C++ and the console. This project was initially meant to read/write accounts to/from a file, but I decided to leave that for the better, improved version.
