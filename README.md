# Bank_V1
This version of a simple bank allows the user (the teller) to create accounts, deposit/withdraw from those accounts, view/edit them, and print out all accounts. This version of it uses C++ and the console. This project was initially meant to read/write accounts to/from a file, but I decided to leave that for the better, improved version.

Bank.h contains the code for all bank functions: creating new customers, searching for them, etc.
Person.h contains the code to create new Person objects (customers).
Main.cpp contains the code for the teller to use to interact with the Bank object.
